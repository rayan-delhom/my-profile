               <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
    <p>
               I'm passionate about bodybuilding.I started in march 2022 and it's already a passion. At the begining I trained everytime with my friend because it was hard to be motivated alone. I train now 6 times a week with my friend or alone. Going to the gym also helps me getting problems out of my head, focus, get confidence and reach the physique I want.

               <h2>Series and Video games</h2>
    <p>
               I love series, animes and video games. Anime are films and series in Japanese animation I watch a lot of those, especially on Netflix and "voiranime". My favorites are "One Piece", "Hunter X Hunter", "Vinland Saga", and the "Dragon ball" series. I also play video games with my friends like Valorant, Counter Strike and league of legend. But my favorite will remain Overwatch because it's the first game I played a lot with all my friends.
